## **Fun Facts App** ##

This repo contains files for a java based android application. The user is shown a fact, and can press the "Show Another Fun Fact " button to be shown another randomly generated fact. The button's text color is randomly changed in addition to the app background.

This app was created through lessons at Treehouse and has been expanded to include 1000 random facts (some topics include: space, animals, food, etc.) and around 25 different random colors.

The app is available for download on the Google Play Store:
